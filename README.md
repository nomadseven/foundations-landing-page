# foundations-landing-page

This is a landing page using multiple techniques in HTML and CSS. This page relies heavily on flexbox for formatting and organizing content. Throughout the process of coding this page, I learned about developing code from scratch without any scaffold, working to troubleshoot alignment and formatting problems, and successfully using the box model and flexbox method.
